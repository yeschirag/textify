Here's a generalized transfer function in terms of Laplace variable s:

bmn8™ + Bm—18™ 1 + +++ +b18 + bo
€n8” + Oy_18" 1 +--+ +418 + a9

G(s)

Where:
eb; and a; are constant coefficients (real or complex),
° m <7, typically n > m to ensure physical realizability (proper system),
¢ Ifm=nN, it's proper, and ifm < 1, it's strictly proper.

This generalized form can represent any LTI system in the Laplace domain—control systems, circuits,

mechanical systems, etc.
