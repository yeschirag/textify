Here's a generalized transfer function in terms of Laplace variable s:

bmn8™ + Bm—18™ 1 + +++ +b18 + bo

G(s) mn md
Gn 8” + Qn_18"-) +++» +018 + a9

Where:

eb; and a; are constant coefficients (real or complex),

° m <7, typically n > m to ensure physical realizability (proper system),

¢ Ifm=nN, it's proper, and ifm < 1, it's strictly proper.
This generalized form can represent any LTI system in the Laplace domain—control systems, circuits,
mechanical systems, etc.

If you want to prank harder, just say:

“Bro, we need to normalize the general transfer function by dividing all terms by @,, then analyze poles
and zeros in the s-plane to check BIBO stability. Didn't you attend the bonus lecture?”

Want a visual representation or fake solved example with crazy roots too?
